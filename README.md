# Running in Circles

(This is an old project that I've always liked, keeping it on Github for Posterity™)

A game made with LÖVE for the Experimental Gameplay Project of September 2010, whose theme was NEVERENDING.

Run it with the latest version of [LÖVE](https://www.love2d.org).

Music : "Intro" by DJ Fire-Black http://www.jamendo.com/fr/album/72849
Sound FXs made by myself
